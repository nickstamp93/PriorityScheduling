# PriorityScheduling
This is a programm that implements the priority scheduling problem . The main idea of the problem is that there are some tasks that want to make use of a resource (such as a CPU) but only one can use the resource at a certain time . Every task has an arrival time , a priority and and an execution time (time that uses the resource) . The purpose is to manage the scheduling of the resource to the tasks considering their arrival time and their priority , so that all tasks will definately use the resource . This is a semester assignment for the course "Thread programming" in my university .
